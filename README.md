# VSTakoyaki

## Takoyaki running as a VST plugin for live audio visualizations

This project is an effort to port the core renderer of [takoyaki](https://github.com/Husenap/takoyaki) into a VST plugin.
The goal is to be able to process live audio input and have the visuals react to it in realtime.
